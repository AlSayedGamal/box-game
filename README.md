## Guess the box game.##
- Assuming that there are 20 boxes each one has a character that's randomly chosen from "aabbccddeeffgghhiijj", your goal is to remove all the boxes by guessing the contents of matched boxes.
How to Play:
- A player can input any box number. [1-20]
- If a player has 2 boxes in row that have the same character these 2 boxes are deleted and can't be used again.
- Player has up to 40 trials to remove the 20 boxes before losing the game.

TODO:
- Decent error messages for bad box number choices.
- Unit testing.
